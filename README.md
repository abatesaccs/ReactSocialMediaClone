# Social Media Clone
#### React Fundamentals
Developing an environment build for a social media wireframe site. 

## Objective 
Build a Social Media Clone site using only React components paralleling the wireframe an actual site with react for hotloading, babel transformation, webpack transpiling, and component reconciliation.

React was originally developed by Facebook to manage the dynamic, complex needs of a large social media app. After observing Facebook's success, many other social media applications have also begun relying on React.

Tip: Take care in determining which portions warrant their own components.
